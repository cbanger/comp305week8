MVC / MySQL Demo program

This repo contains the Java project that was developed in class, Friday Mar 6.   
The project uses the sample travel MySQL database that comes with NetBeans.
A small number of (3-4) errors have been deliberately introduced to the code.

TODO:
    Open the project in NetBeans.    
    Read and document all of the code. 
    Run the project.    
    Check the output window for any error messages.
    Identify and fix the problems that cause the error messages.      
    When all of the problems have been fixed, the contents of the 'person' table will be printed in the output window.
